# Attestation System Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This update implements a complete refactoring of the UFSC attestation system, moving from automatic generation to a 100% manual upload system with individual attestations for each license.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Automatic Generation System
- **Removed:** `wp_ajax_ufsc_generate_attestation` hook and `ufsc_handle_generate_attestation()` function
- **Removed:** `generate_attestation()` and `create_attestation_pdf()` methods from UFSC_Document_Manager
- **Removed:** `generateAttestation()` JavaScript function and "Générer" button from admin interface
- **Removed:** `ufsc_remove_attestation` handler (replaced with new system)

### 2. Database Migration
- **Added:** `attestation_url` column (VARCHAR 255 NULL) to `wp_ufsc_licences` table
- **Migration:** Automatic database upgrade system using existing `apply_database_patches()` method
- **Backward Compatible:** Existing installations automatically updated

### 3. New Manual Upload System for Club Attestations
- **Added:** `ufsc_upload_club_attestation` AJAX endpoint
- **Added:** `ufsc_delete_club_attestation` AJAX endpoint
- **Security:** Admin-only access with `manage_options` capability
- **Validation:** File type (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG), size (5MB max), MIME type checking
- **Storage:** Files stored in `/wp-content/uploads/ufsc-attestations/` directory
- **Naming:** `club_{clubID}_{type}_{timestamp}.{ext}` format
- **Cleanup:** Automatic deletion of old files when replaced

### 4. New Manual Upload System for License Attestations
- **Added:** `ufsc_upload_licence_attestation` AJAX endpoint
- **Added:** `ufsc_delete_licence_attestation` AJAX endpoint
- **Security:** Admin-only access with same validation as club attestations
- **Storage:** Same secure directory structure
- **Naming:** `licence_{licenceID}_attestation_{timestamp}.{ext}` format
- **Database:** Stores URL in `attestation_url` column

### 5. Updated Admin Interface
- **Club Edit Page:** Replaced generation button with upload/replace/delete controls
- **License List:** Added "Attestation" column with upload/download/replace/delete actions
- **User Experience:** Clear buttons for different actions (Upload, Replace, Delete)
- **Feedback:** Visual indicators for existing vs missing attestations

### 6. Updated Frontend Interface
- **License List:** Added "Attestation" column for club owners
- **Downloads:** Secure download links with nonce protection
- **Display:** Shows download link or "—" for missing attestations

### 7. Centralized JavaScript
- **Created:** `assets/js/ufsc-attestations.js` for all attestation management
- **Features:** File upload with progress, validation, error handling
- **AJAX:** Handles all upload/delete operations with proper nonce verification
- **UI:** Real-time feedback and auto-reload after successful operations

### 8. Security Enhancements
- **File Validation:** Strict file type and size checking
- **Path Security:** Prevention of directory traversal attacks
- **Nonce Protection:** All AJAX requests protected with WordPress nonces
- **Access Control:** Admin-only uploads, club-owner downloads
- **Secure Downloads:** Protected download URLs with verification

### 9. Test Updates
- **Updated:** `class-test-helper.php` to check new hooks instead of old generation hook
- **Updated:** `attestation-functionality-test.php` to test new AJAX handlers
- **Comprehensive:** Tests for all new upload/delete endpoints

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins
1. **Club Attestations:**
   - Navigate to club edit page
   - Use upload buttons in "Attestations administratives" section
   - Replace or delete existing attestations as needed

2. **License Attestations:**
   - Go to license list page
   - Use buttons in "Attestation" column for each license
   - Upload individual attestations per license

### For Club Owners
1. Navigate to license list on frontend
2. Download available attestations using secure links
3. Attestations are only visible for own club's licenses

## Security Features
- **Admin-only Upload:** Only users with `manage_options` can upload
- **Club Owner Access:** Club owners can only download their own attestations
- **File Type Validation:** Restricted to safe file types (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- **Size Limits:** Maximum 5MB per file
- **Secure Storage:** Files stored in protected directory
- **Nonce Protection:** All operations protected against CSRF
- **Path Validation:** Prevents directory traversal attacks

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing club attestations using media library continue to work
- Database migration is automatic and non-destructive
- No data loss during upgrade
- Gradual transition possible

## Configuration
- **File Storage:** `/wp-content/uploads/ufsc-attestations/`
- **Max File Size:** 5MB (configurable in code)
- **Allowed Types:** PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **Season:** Implicit 2025-2026 (no multi-season support yet)

## Future Enhancements (Not Included)
- Multi-season support with historical attestations
- Date tracking for attestation updates
- Automatic PDF generation
- Dedicated database table for attestation history
- Bulk operations for multiple licenses

This implementation provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly attestation management system that replaces the previous automatic generation with manual upload capabilities while maintaining all security and usability requirements.
